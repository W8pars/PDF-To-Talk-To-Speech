# PDF-To-Talk-To-Speech
two different ways to convert a pdf file, using PyPDF2, into text and converting this text into speech. I wrote two different versions using the Google TTS API and the gTTS library to avoid using an API. 
If you do use the GTTSAPI method, you must set up your Google Cloud Platform project and download your json key file and include it with your project. :)
